## Running the Program 

You can run the program with the following command (assuming you have racket installed)

```
racket mode.rkt
```

There is also a batch flag for running several commands in a row. Intended to be used by a piping in input from a file.
You need to use `-b` or `-batch` after `mode.rkt` as it is a flag for the program not racket.

```
    racket mode.rkt -b < test.txt
```
